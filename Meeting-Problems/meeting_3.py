# Warmup

# Lets say you are given a document that contains the price for a given stock on each day for a given year. 
# Write a program to find the maximum profit that could be attained by buying and selling one share of that stock.

    '''
        Args: Prices: list
        Returns: max profit: int

        if val < min_val:

# print(find([100,2,5,200,50,1,400])) # 399 âœ…



# Problem 1:
